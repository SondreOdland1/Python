# Common examples of tuples is coordinates.
# Tuples use () around the values and lists use [] around values

coordinates = (4, 5) #A tuple is immutable, witch means its unchangeble, it can't be modified

print(coordinates[0]) #printer ut index 0 som er 4 i dette eksampelet. 
print(coordinates[1])


# Tuples is good to use when you have data that never will change

# you can also make a list with tuples inside

kordinater = [(4, 5), (6,7), (69, 70)]

print(kordinater[0])
